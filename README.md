# Loss-Measurements-in-a-Turbine-Cascade
The objective of this report is to evaluate, by measurements, the loss coefficient for a turbine blade row. This experiment has been carried out on a linear non rotating cascade blade row, long enough to disregard the near-wall effects. Tip leaking losses and end wall losses will be disregarded in this experiment. The focus is on the profile losses. The aerodynamic loss coefficient is determined through experimental measures, based on probe transverse measurements. Different parameters, like the inlet angle and the surface roughness, are modified, so that their influence is studied in the process.
